The front end for a full stack application I'm building with react.js

This will be a front end application where someone can upload a PDF file against their profile

It should:
Allow a user to register
Allow a user to sign in
Upload a file against their profile
View a list of files they've uploaded

These are however long term goals, right now the goal is to use this to learn React.js and CSS
